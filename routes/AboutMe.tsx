            <p>
            Welcome to my website! I'm Gustavo Quiroz, a front-end web developer with a passion for creating things. 
            <br/>
            I started my journey in web development in October 2022, beginning with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and moving to more advanced tools. 
            Before becoming a web developer, I worked in motion graphics but wanted a more challenging career. 
            <br/>
            As a web developer, I get to combine my love for creating with my passion for problem-solving. 
            I'm also interested in investing and staying up to date with the latest global economy trends.
