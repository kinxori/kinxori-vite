          <h3>Career? üë®‚Äçüéì</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout my career path, I have pursued my
            <b> passion for creativity and visual arts. </b>
            After graduating with a degree in
            <b> Animation and Visual Effects in 2020, </b> I landed a job as a 2D Cut-Out Animator
            and Background Illustrator from 2020-2021. This was just the start of my journey, as I
            eventually progressed to become a<b> Lead Motion Designer </b> in a Canadian marketing
            agency in <b> August, 2021. </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I had a great career in the visual arts industry,
            <b>I felt the need to learn new skills and broaden my horizons.</b>
            This is why in
            <b> October 2022, </b> I decided to
            <b> start learning web development. </b> My passion for
            <b> problem-solving </b> and creating meaningful experiences through
            <b> web design </b>
            grew, and in <b> January 2023, </b> I made the decision to
            <b> pursue web development as a full-time job. </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am focusing on developing myself as a<b> Front-End Developer, </b> and I am
            determined to become a<b> Full-Stack Developer </b> in the near future. My career
            journey has been an exciting and fulfilling experience, and I look forward to what the
            future holds as I continue to
            <b> grow and evolve as a developer. </b>
          </p>

          <h3>Hobbies? üçø</h3>
          <p>
            Talking about hobbies, <b> biking and tennis are my favorite sport activities, </b> I
            also enjoy <b> going to the beach </b> and spending time in nature. When I'm not
            outside, I enjoy exploring my creative side through <b> music and craftsmanship. </b> I
            play guitar and am interested in <b> learning the violin and saxophone. </b> I'm also
            <b> interested in investing </b> and learning about global economy and tendencies in the
            market. Overall, I'm someone who likes to
            <b> keep learning and enjoy life's simple pleasures. </b>

          <h3>Aspirations? ‚è≥</h3>
          <p>
            My main aspiration in life is to <b> achieve financial freedom, </b> not just for
            myself, but also to <b> share a comfortable life with my loved ones. </b> I believe that
            personal growth is important, and I am <b> always eager to learn new things </b> and
            gain knowledge to help me <b> reach my goals. </b> One of my passions is exploring new
            places and <b> experiencing different cultures, </b> which is why I aspire to live a
            fulfilling life where I can travel and <b> create unforgettable memories </b> with those
            closest to me. Ultimately, what <b> I strive for is a peaceful and fulfilling life, </b>
            where I can enjoy the simple things in life and cherish the moments
            <b> spent with the people who matter most to me. </b>
